# vue/block-spacing
> disallow or enforce spaces inside of blocks after opening block and before closing block

- :wrench: The `--fix` option on the [command line](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface#fixing-problems) can automatically fix some of the problems reported by this rule.

This rule is the same rule as core [block-spacing] rule but it applies to the expressions in `<template>`.
