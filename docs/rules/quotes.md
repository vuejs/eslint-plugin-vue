> Enforce the consistent use of either backticks, double, or single quotes in `<template>`

- :exclamation: <badge text="This rule has not been released yet." vertical="middle" type="error"> ***This rule has not been released yet.*** </badge>
- :wrench: The `--fix` option on the [command line](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface#fixing-problems) can automatically fix some of the problems reported by this rule.

This rule is the same rule as stylistic [quotes] rule but it applies to the expressions in `<template>`.
