# vue/dot-location

> Enforce consistent newlines before and after dots in `<template>`

- :wrench: The `--fix` option on the [command line](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface#fixing-problems) can automatically fix some of the problems reported by this rule.

This rule is the same rule as [@stylistic/dot-location] rule but it applies to the expressions in `<template>`.

This rule extends the rule that [@stylistic/eslint-plugin] has, but if [@stylistic/eslint-plugin] is not installed, this rule extracts and extends the same rule from ESLint core.
However, if neither is found, the rule cannot be used.
