# vue/script-setup-uses-vars

> prevent `<script setup>` variables used in `<template>` to be marked as unused

- :exclamation: <badge text="This rule has not been released yet." vertical="middle" type="error"> ***This rule has not been released yet.*** </badge>
- :gear: This rule is included in all of `"plugin:vue/base"`, `"plugin:vue/essential"`, `"plugin:vue/vue3-essential"`, `"plugin:vue/strongly-recommended"`, `"plugin:vue/vue3-strongly-recommended"`, `"plugin:vue/recommended"` and `"plugin:vue/vue3-recommended"`.

ESLint `no-unused-vars` rule does not detect variables in `<script setup>` used in `<template>`.
This rule will find variables in `<script setup>` used in `<template>` and mark them as used.

This rule only has an effect when the `no-unused-vars` rule is enabled.

## :book: Rule Details

Without this rule this code triggers warning:

<eslint-code-block :rules="{'vue/script-setup-uses-vars': ['error'], 'no-unused-vars': ['error']}">

```vue
<script setup>
  // imported components are also directly usable in template
  import Foo from './Foo.vue'
  import { ref } from 'vue'

  // write Composition API code just like in a normal setup()
  // but no need to manually return everything
  const count = ref(0)
  const inc = () => {
    count.value++
  }
</script>

<template>
  <Foo :count="count" @click="inc" />
</template>
```

</eslint-code-block>

After turning on, `Foo` is being marked as used and `no-unused-vars` rule doesn't report an issue.

## :mute: When Not To Use It

If you are not using `<script setup>` or if you do not use the `no-unused-vars` rule then you can disable this rule.
