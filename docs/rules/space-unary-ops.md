# vue/space-unary-ops
> enforce consistent spacing before or after unary operators

- :wrench: The `--fix` option on the [command line](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface#fixing-problems) can automatically fix some of the problems reported by this rule.

This rule is the same rule as core [space-unary-ops] rule but it applies to the expressions in `<template>`.
