# disallow confusing `v-for` and `v-if` on the same element (vue/no-confusing-v-for-v-if)

- :gear: This rule is included in `"plugin:vue/recommended"`.

> When they exist on the same node, `v-for` has a higher priority than `v-if`. That means the `v-if` will be run on each iteration of the loop separately.

So when they exist on the same node, `v-if` directive should use the reference which is to the variables which are defined by the `v-for` directives.

## :book: Rule Details

This rule reports the elements which have both `v-for` and `v-if` directives in the following cases:

- The `v-if` directive does not use the reference which is to the variables which are defined by the `v-for` directives.

In that case, the `v-if` should be written on the wrapper element.

:-1: Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```html
<TodoItem
  v-if="complete"
  v-for="todo in todos"
  :todo="todo"
/>
```

```html
<ul v-if="shown">
  <TodoItem
    v-for="todo in todos"

</ul>
```
